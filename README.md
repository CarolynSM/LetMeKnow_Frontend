# Let me know: the RSVP App

Let me know is a mobile-first app that allows hosts to manage the guest list for an upcoming event. 

### How it works:
The host dashboard allows hosts to view the current invite list, who's responsed, is coming, and is bringing a friend. The list also generates a total head count. The host also has the option to add and delete invites from the list, as well as manually update an RSVP. An additional table at the bottom lists "Plus One's" and who they're coming with.

A simple RSVP form allows guest to update their response - which is immediately available within the host dashboard.

### Technologies used:
- Backend: Express, CORS, PostgreSQL, Knex.js (see backend repo [here](https://github.com/CarolynSM/LetMeKnow_Backend)
- Frontend: React.js (including React Router, React Modal), Chart.js
- End to End tests: Cypress
